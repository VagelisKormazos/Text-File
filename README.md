# Text-File

You are given a text file which has only ASCII
characters. First, edit it appropriately so that you are left with
text with only letters and the space character.
Divide this text into words according to the space and start
remove pairs of words if the sum of their letters is 20.
Take out the statistics for the length of the words left, e.g. 10 words
12 words of 2 letters, 3 words of 3 letters
etc. The pairs need not be of consecutive words.
